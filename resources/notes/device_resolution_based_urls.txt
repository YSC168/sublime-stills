Resolution based image urls

1. Create a DeviceResolution object which contains device width and height values.

2. Add method Image#getImage(Pixel width, Pixel height) which returns the best possible resolution matched url. 
Favorite images can return stored values since they will be stored based on what is ideal for the device. 
OR
2. Explore viability of a base image url on which resolution transformations can be done to obtain a resolution adjusted url. 
If this is possible, change FavoriteImageModel to make use of this base url when sharing images. Since some services may not 
support this base url scheme keep the old database columns for image urls.
